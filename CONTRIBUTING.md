# Contributing to Northwind Traders
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase 
(we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the Apache License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same 
[Apache License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/apache-2.0/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if 
that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/PekinSOFT-Systems/Northwind-RCP/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by 
[opening a new issue](https://github.com/PekinSOFT-Systems/Northwind-RCP/issues/new/choose); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
When reporting a bug against Northwind Traders RCP, use the [bug report template](https://github.com/PekinSOFT-Systems/Northwind-RCP/issues/new/choose)
to create your report. This template provides seven (7) sections, not all of which will apply:

1. Describe the Bug: be as detailed about the bug as you possibly can.
2. To Reproduce: provide detailed steps that we can emulate to reproduce as close to the exact environment in which the bug occurred.
3. Expected Behavior: tell us what you expected to happen once you completed the steps of the last section.
4. Screenshots: provide screenshots, if appropriate, to show us the bug.
5. Desktop Information: provide your system architecture, operating system and version (build), the amount of memory installed, HDD size
(total and free), other simultaneously running applications, etc.
6. Smartphone Information: obviously, only applicable for applications or portions of applications that run on a smartphone.
7. Additional Context: ***application users***: this should be a copy of the application log file or other information that you believe 
will help us to track down the bug; ***code contributors***: this should be complete code sections that are pertinent to the bug being
reported.

If any of these seven (7) sections do not apply to your specific bug report, please delete them from the bug report and/or change them 
to a different section that you feel should be included in your report.

Check out this [example bug report...](https://github.com/PekinSOFT-Systems/Northwind-RCP/issues/8)

Provided that you use our [bug report template](https://github.com/PekinSOFT-Systems/Northwind-RCP/issues/new/choose), you will always
submit **great bug reports**!

***AND***:

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
Since we are developing a NetBeans Platform RCP application, we are using the NetBeans IDE for development. Because of this, we have
fantastic tools available within the IDE for making sure that our code is clean and readable, as well as well-formatted.

We prefer code following this style:
* 4 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
* 8 spaces for multi-line executable code.
* Thorough JavaDoc comments, including detailed information regarding the method and what it does, the parameters, the return type, and
any exceptions that may be thrown.
* Instead of comments using the various comment markers (`//`, `/* */`), use the logging feature to place your comments into the code.
    - Of course, use the appropriate logging level for your entries.
* Use CTRL+SHIFT+I for importing libraries, so that the imports will always be well organized
* Use ALT+SHIFT+F to cleanly format your code, prior to committing/pushing to the repository.
