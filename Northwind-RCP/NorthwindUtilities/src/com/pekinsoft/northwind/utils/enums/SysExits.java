/**
 * PekinSOFT Systems System Exit Codes.  The following enumerations are used
 * throughout all PekinSOFT Systems programs for error codes and exit status 
 * codes.  We do this to enable our systems to report back to the operating 
 * system how they exited or what error they encountered while executing.  This 
 * allows software written and designed by PekinSOFT Systems to be automated 
 * through shell scripts and allow the shell scripts to test the exit status in 
 * order to take appropriate action.  The error codes used by Integrity 
 * Solutions programs are taken from the Linux C header file 'sysexits.h' to 
 * stay standardized with other Linux/Unix programs.  Other error codes are 
 * added as needed by PekinSOFT Systems software, if the error is not 
 * otherwise covered by the standard error codes that are already in sysexits.h.
 * <p>
 * PekinSOFT Systems is reusing these constants, directly from the {@code 
 * sysexits.h} file, in compliance with the Berkeley License:</p>
